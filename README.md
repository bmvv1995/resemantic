# ReSemantic: Proposition-Based Memory System

Testing semantic unit extraction vs atomic propositionalization for embeddings.

## The Problem
- **Semantic units** (summarized) = good for narrative structure, bad for embeddings
- **Propositions** (atomic facts) = optimal for vector matching and retrieval

## Experiment
Compare two approaches:
1. **Baseline**: Direct LLM prompting for proposition extraction
2. **DSPy**: Optimized signatures with examples for proposition extraction

## Test Data
Our own conversation about semantic memory systems.
